# engn-final

there's alot of stuff here

most of it is not actually used in my final construction

if you just want to know how the final version works, here are the relevant pieces:
	1. motor_and_temp  -- this code runs on the arduino\n
	2. tempfrombt.py   -- this code runs every 5 mins on the pi\n
	3. twilio webhook.js  -- this is the webhook that runs for twiliio\n
	4. thermometer data webapp.js -- this is the script that creates core google sheet db\n

best of luck reading my messy code\n
thanks for a fantastic class!
