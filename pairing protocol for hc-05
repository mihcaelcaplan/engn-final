pairing protocol for hc-05:

connect to arduino correctly lol

bluetoothctl

# scan on
	find mac of hc-05
	also accessible in AT command mode with AT-ADDR? with arduino

# agent on
# pair xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

# enter passkey 
	1234 by default 

exit bluetoothctl

bind hc-05 to rfcomm with 
$ sudo rfcomm bind 0 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

98:D3:31:FC:44:24

added a crontab event to bind to rfcomm @reboot
